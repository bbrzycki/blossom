Initial Thoughts

- having classes for organisms is probably a good idea
- use parameter file to initialize each run

- what do we want per class? what determines an organism?
    - split by dimension

1D Class (Int position)

- on a number line

- binary DNA (011010101110)
    - makes it easier to compare
    - should this reflect any properties or behavior? 
        - would make it a lot more interesting
- position (int)
- age (int / timestep)
- food
    - would have to correspond with some way of *obtaining* food, whether from environment or other organisms
    - would be nice to have an option *not* to have food / water as a state that's taken into consideration
    - track current food level + total food level
- water
    - we could / should be able to combine food + water, probably, just for simplicity
    - track current water level + total water level
- movement patterns
    - randomness
        - potential alternatives to *pure* randomness
    - fatigue?
- reproduction or replication
- sex?

Environment
- how do we deal with environments? land, water, temperature gradient, natural food / plants?

2D really only changes the position prescription, movement patterns, and environment

BaseOrganism class; *necessary* states

- DNA
- position (depends on dimension)
- age
- movement patterns
