Initial Thoughts

- having classes for organisms is probably a good idea
- use parameter file to initialize each run

- what do we want per class? what determines an organism?
    - split by dimension

1D Class (Int position)

- on a number line

- binary DNA (011010101110)
    - makes it easier to compare
    - should this reflect any properties or behavior?
        - would make it a lot more interesting
- position (int)
- age (int / timestep)
- food
    - would have to correspond with some way of *obtaining* food, whether from environment or other organisms
    - would be nice to have an option *not* to have food / water as a state that's taken into consideration
    - track current food level + total food level
- water
    - we could / should be able to combine food + water, probably, just for simplicity
    - track current water level + total water level
- movement patterns
    - randomness
        - potential alternatives to *pure* randomness
    - fatigue?
- reproduction or replication
- sex?

Environment
- how do we deal with environments? land, water, temperature gradient, natural food / plants?

2D really only changes the position prescription, movement patterns, and environment

BaseOrganism class; *necessary* states

- DNA
- position (depends on dimension)
- age
- movement patterns

Look into bokeh package for visualization

To store things, what do we need:

species: all the identification information -- we can also just read this from the parameter files every time though
organisms: the stuff that species information doesn't tell us
    some kind of identifier, DNA, age, position
    but if we want this to be malleable, we should include other quantities as well!
but in that case, is it even worth having a 'species' identifier
i think it is, because then you can track how each species changes
but is it necessary to form classes of them
idk
maybe the organism initialization + storage have to keep everything in mind,
to deal with random fluctuations, but the species definition is pretty constant


no need to repeat species info for each organism... unless they change behavior
    which we might want later on, because that'd be interesting

ID        Species   DNA       Age       Position  [rest of params...]
****      ****      ****      ****      ****      ****
